    "# Sample Dataset Collection\n",
    "Please use online [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jacksoncrow/data-collection-demo) to avoid extra efforts of setting up the environment. In case you want to run this locally, Kaggle notebook would still be handy as a reference since we are setting up the environment there from scratch.\n",

    "## Constant definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Fist of all, we need to specify some input parameters to our script. That is, input file with articles we want to download + parameters on how to download them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input file\n",
    "It should be a file with article ids specified one per line. By article id here we mean last part of its URL. That is, for the article with URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Relapse on English Wikipedia, the id would be `The_Relapse`. Please note, that all article ids you specified in a file should be from the same Wikipedia, i.e. either all English or all Ukrainian.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "Then you need to specify a variety of parameters to fine-tune the collection script. On a high level, the script accounts to any previously downloaded information to increase the performance. In other words, once you downloaded a dataset from scratch, updating it will take very little time. That is because most of the data will be already downloaded and unmodified since the last collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, since script leverages cache, you can interrupt and then restart the collection script at any time without the need to start everything from scratch. You can also specify, what precisely you want the script to do 1) download missing articles and images from the input file 2) check that image metadata of already downloaded articles is up to date 3) force redownload off all images and/or image metadata and/or article text content. You can also execute the script from multiple notebooks/consoles with the same output directory to parallelise the collection process. That will significantly reduce the download time, although you need to beware that not any (offset, limit) parameters overlap. We are planning to add support of multithreading in the future, so now it's the only workaround. If you more details on parameters, please refer to documentation in the corresponding python file."
